# FC Starter Theme: Functions

A Directory for all the required PHP functions for the theme, as well as a bunch of functions that you may find useful.  These could all be in `../functions.php` but this is quite a bit tidier.

If you need to add any functions as you build the site, add them to an appropriate new `/functions/functions-{X}.php` file.
